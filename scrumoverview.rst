An introduction
---------------

.. note::

    Welcome to the presenter console!

----

...but first, a little context.

.. note::

    Here you have a view of the current slide, a preview of the next slide
    and your notes.

*What is process?*
=======================

At a high level, it’s the phases that a software system transitions though as it’s being modified.  At a more granular level, it’s the values, tools, ‘flows’ and information exchanges that are put in place by an organization when they are developing a software system.

.. note::

    You also have a clock and a timer, so you know how much time you have
    left.

----

*Why is process important?*
===========================

Process is important because it **adds structure to complex and chaotic events**.  It defines development culture, it sets business expectations, it reduces risks and increases customer involvement.

    You also have a clock and a timer, so you know how much time you have
    left.

----

A few well-known processes:
===========================

.. note::

    If you click on the timer it restarts from zero. This is handy when you
    are rehearsing the presentation and need to make sure it fits in the time
    allocated.

Waterfall
================

Notoriously crappy for software.

Prototype
=========

Not so much a process itself, more of a technique within a process.

----

Spiral
======

Getting better, but not 'team focused'.

The Agile family
================

* Lean software

* eXtreme Programming

* Scrum

* KanBan

* .... and many others

Scrum
===========
An implementation that I have seen work (really well).

.. note::

   If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space every time you run
   out of things to say!

The Scrum flow
==============

.. note::

    Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
    then to make presentations interesting?

*Backlogs? Iterations?  Don't we already do that?*
==================================================

Yes, but Scrum provides some additional characteristics that changes how we develop software... and how we communicate to 'the client'.

    Wow! 3D! You didn't see that one coming, did you?

Let's take a look....

* Iterations are capacity-based.
* Development goals are set on a sprint-by-sprint basis.
* Once a sprint has started, the sprint backlog should not be changed.
* Releases are done at the end of an iteration (if approved).

Ok, that's not *too* much different than what we are doing.

Here are a few things to consider.

Pros
====
* Communication is increased between development and business.
* Goals are set at the beginning of a sprint and progress can be tracked via the project burndown, this means fewer surprises.
* Time is tracked by all ‘team’ parties, so, in time, we should develop a good idea of the team’s velocity across sprints.
* …this also has accounting benefits.
* The Team is empowered by having a say on what is in the Sprint Backlog and is encouraged to push back on deadlines.
* A planned approach forces you to finish dependencies in previous sprints (comps, spikes, etc.).

Cons
====
* Additional diligence must be done but the SO (Brando) to make sure that Stories are impecibally defined with extremely terse Definitions of Done.
* Hotfixes can be very disruptive.
* Team morale can be more tumultuous (the accordion effect).
* Time tracking can lead to a ‘do it quick, not right’ attitude, which leads to technical debt.
* The team loses the freedom to self-prioritize chores for the greater good of the codebase.
* Less pairing means less leveling-up.
