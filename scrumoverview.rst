Scrum:
======

An empirical overview
---------------------

----


...but first, a little context.

----

*What is process?*
=======================

At a high level, it’s the phases that a software system transitions though as it’s being modified.  At a more granular level, it’s the values, tools, ‘flows’ and information exchanges that are put in place by an organization when they are developing a software system.

----

*Why is process important?*
===========================

Process is important because it **adds structure to complex and chaotic events**.  It defines development culture, it sets business expectations, it reduces risks and increases customer involvement.

----

A few well-known processes:

Waterfall
================

Notoriously crappy for software.

----

:data-rotate-y: r0

Prototype
=========

Not so much a process itself, more of a technique within a process.

----

Spiral
======

Getting better, but not 'team focused'.

The Agile family
================

* Lean software

* eXtreme Programming

* Scrum

* KanBan

* .... and many others

Scrum
===========
An implementation that I have seen work (really well).

*Backlogs? Iterations?  Don't we already do that?*
==================================================

Yes, but Scrum provides some additional characteristics that changes how we develop software... and how we communicate to 'the client'.

Let's take a look....
=====================

----

:data-x: r1400
:data-y: r-300
:data-z: r-500

* Iterations are capacity-based.
* Development goals are set on a sprint-by-sprint basis.
* Releases are done at the end of an iteration (if approved).

Ok, that's not *too* much different than what we are doing.
===========================================================
LET'S GO FOR IT!

Here are a few things to consider.

Pros
====
* Communication is increased between development and business.
* Goals are set at the beginning of a sprint and progress can be tracked via the project burndown, this means fewer surprises.
* Time is tracked by all ‘team’ parties, so, in time, we should develop a good idea of the team’s velocity across sprints.
* Time tracking also has accounting benefits.
* The Team is empowered by having a say on what is in the Sprint Backlog and is encouraged to push back on deadlines.
* A planned approach forces you to finish dependencies in previous sprints (comps, spikes, etc.).

----

:data-y: r1200

Cons
====
* Additional diligence must be done buy the SO (Brando) to make sure that Stories are impecibally defined with extremely terse Definitions of Done.
* Hotfixes can be very disruptive.
* Team morale can be more tumultuous (the accordion effect).
* Time tracking can lead to a ‘do it quick, not right’ attitude, which leads to technical debt.
* The team loses the freedom to self-prioritize chores for the greater good of the codebase.
* Less pairing means less leveling-up.

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r1200

*So how do we keep the Pros and mitigate the Cons?*
===================================================

* Complete buy-in from leadership.
* An exceptionally groomed backlog.
* 'Goals' !== 'commitments'.
* Goals ARE NOT COMMITMENTS!!
* Minimize sprint backlog churn.
* Time tracking is for team growth, not accountability.
